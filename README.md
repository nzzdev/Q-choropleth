cd ./Q-choropleth
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

There's one env variable `METHOD_BOX_ARTICLE` that needs to be defined. `METHOD_BOX_ARTICLE` is an object that contains two properties: `title` and `url`.
Those properties will be used in the `MethodBox`-component. The defined article will lead to the article where we show how we caluclate the bucketing method.

## Development

Start the Q dev server:

```
npx @nzz/q-cli server
```

Run the Q tool:

```
node index.js
```

## Testing

The testing framework used in this repository is [Code](https://github.com/hapijs/code).

Run the tests:

```
npm run test
```

### Implementing a new test

When changing or implementing...

- A `route`, it needs to be tested in the `e2e-tests.js` file
- Something on the frontend, it needs to be tested in the `dom-tests.js` file

## Deployment

We provide automatically built docker images at https://hub.docker.com/r/nzzonline/q-xxx/.
There are three options for deployment:

- Use the provided images
- Build your own docker images
- Deploy the service using another technology

### Use the provided docker images

1. Deploy `nzzonline/q-choropleth` to a docker environment
2. Set the ENV variables as described in the [configuration section](#configuration)

## Functionality

The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).

### Features

#### Basemaps

The basemaps are saved as `json`-format in the following structure:

- `type`: the type of the map. Currently the only type implemented is "Geometry"
- `config`: contains the following properties `rows`, `columns` and `grid`. `grid` is an array of arrays, where the structure of the map is set.

Ex.:

```
"grid": [
    [null, null, "BS", "BL", "SH", "TG", null],
    [null, "JU", "SO", "AG", "ZH", "AR", "AI"],
    [null, "NE", "BE", "LU", "ZG", "SZ", "SG"],
    ["VD", "FR", "OW", "NW", "UR", "GL", "GR"],
    ["GE", null, "VS", null, null, "TI", null]
]
```

- `cantons`: an array of objects, containing the `id`, `code` and `name`

The `json`-files will then be implemented in the `entityCollection`-route. The infos will then be available by calling the function `getEntityCollectionInfo`, which will be usable when implementing the `baseMap`-helper.

#### Hexagon

The hexagon-objects will be created in the function `getHexagons()`, where the grid passed by the `entityCollectionInfo` will be iterated and filled up with the following information:

- `text`: the `cantonCode` and the `displayValue`
- `fontSize`: font-size based on the `contentWidth`,
- `color`: color based on the `cantonCode` and the `legendData`,
- `width`: pre-defined,
- `height`: pre-defined,
- `type`: either `fill` or `stroke`,
- `x`,
- `y`: `rowIndex` \* `rowHeight`

The array of hexagons will then be iterated in the `HexagonCHCantonsMap` component, where all the information will be passed to the `Hexagon` component.
The function `getPolygonPoints()` will then process those information used to display the polygon.

#### Sizing

All calculations we use for sizing is based from the [redblobgames hexagons guide](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/). The functions used are in the `hexagon.js` helper-file.
